# Shopping Cart Test

<b>This is a shopping site test, made to train my skills using Typescript and React.

## What was used in this project?

<b>Typescript and React.

## How it Works?

<b>The project is simple. I created a website simulating an online shopping page where the customer could add, remove (item by item or completely), know the price of each item separately and also the price of all items added to the cart.

## Demonstrations

<b>This is the "Add to cart" button working (and if you look to the right top of the page, you can see that the cart button change as you add more items to the cart).

<b>This is the side menu to see what you've put into your cart, for exit, just click on the screen outside the side menu.

<b>And this is your shopping cart. You can click on the "+" button to increase quantity of the selected item, you can click on the "-" to decrease the quantity of the selected item or just click on the trash button to remove all from the selected item.
